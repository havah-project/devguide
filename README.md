# Welcome

HAVAH is a blockchain engine based on [ICON](https://www.icon.foundation/). Basic operations such as smart contract creation and distribution, transaction request, and json-RPC interworking are the same as those of ICON.

This document contains the guide for testnet access information and smart contract creation.
 

## Smart contract

HAVAH writes smart contracts in the same way as ICON Java SCORE.

Please check the HAVAH Smart Contract sample document first.

- [HAVAH Smart Contract sample](https://github.com/havah-project/smart-contract-examples)


Refer to the document below for the Smart Contract API and utility library (scorex) used when writing smart contracts.

- [Smart Contract API Document](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/foundation.icon/javaee-api/latest/index.html)

- [scorex](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/foundation.icon/javaee-api/latest/index.html)
 

Only allowed Java methods can be used when writing smart contracts. A list of allow methods can be found at the link below.

- [Smart Contract allowed methods](https://github.com/icon-project/devportal/blob/master/java-score-1/allowed-methods)
 

## HAVAH SDK

Currently, there is no dedicated SDK for HAVAH. Integration is possible using the ICON SDK.

## Vega (testnet)

Vega is the name of the HAVAH testnet. Access information is as follows.

- JSON-RPC API endpoint

	- [https://ctz.vega.havah.io/api/v3](https://ctz.vega.havah.io/api/v3)

- nid (network id)

	- 0x101

- Block Explorer (HAVAH scan)

	- [https://scan.vega.havah.io](https://scan.vega.havah.io)

- Fauset

	- If you pass your wallet address, we will deposit 100HVH to that address.
